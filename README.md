CyanoManus is a General Purpose Multi-Agent System designed to help users leverage the capabilities of cutting-edge AI models for automating various tasks and gathering information across work and daily life scenarios. Powered by the OpenAI Agents SDK, CyanoManus features a modular architecture with decoupled design components, allowing users to freely distribute and extend the project code.

The name "CyanoManus" is derived from Cyanobacteria, reflecting our aspiration to contribute to the future development of intelligent agents. We believe this project can help advance artificial intelligence technology in a way that enables AI to collaborate with humans more naturally and profoundly to accomplish real-world tasks.

Agent

CyanoManus implements a hierarchical agent structure where specialized agents collaborate to complete complex tasks:

- **Coordinator**: Manages user interaction and overall workflow
- **Planner**: Develops strategies for task completion
- **Supervisor**: Oversees specialized agents
- **Researcher**: Gathers and analyzes information
- **Coder**: Handles programming tasks
- **Operator**: Executes system operations
- **Retriever**: Searches and retrieves relevant data
- **Reporter**: Compiles and presents results to users
